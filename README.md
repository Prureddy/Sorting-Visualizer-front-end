# Sorting_Visualizer

The Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web application that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It provides a visual representation of how different sorting algorithms work by animating the sorting process step by step. This project aims to help individuals understand and learn popular sorting algorithms by providing a visual and intuitive experience.

Features: Interactive Visualization: Users can see the sorting algorithms in action with a visual representation of the sorting process. They can observe how elements are rearranged and compare the efficiency of different algorithms.

Algorithm Selection: The Sorting Visualizer supports a range of popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more. Users can select and visualize the algorithm of their choice.

Customization Options: Users can customize various aspects of the visualization, such as the array size, animation speed, and color schemes. This allows them to experiment and observe the impact of different parameters on the sorting algorithms.

Real-Time Statistics: The application provides real-time statistics on the number of comparisons and swaps performed during the sorting process. This helps users analyze and compare the performance of different algorithms.

User-Friendly Interface: The Sorting Visualizer offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface, making it accessible to users with varying levels of programming knowledge. It provides clear instructions and controls to interact with the visualization.
