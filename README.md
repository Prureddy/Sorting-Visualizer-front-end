# Sorting_Visualizer

The Sorting Visualizer is a web application that demonstrates various sorting algorithms visually. It allows users to visualize the process of sorting an array, helping them understand how different algorithms work and how they compare in terms of efficiency.

Check out the live demo of the Sorting Visualizer [[here]](https://prureddy.github.io/myPortfolio/)

## Features

- **Array Generation**: Automatically generate an array of random elements or provide a custom input.
- **Visualization**: Watch the sorting algorithm in action as the bars representing the array elements get rearranged.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose from a range of popular sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the visualization to observe the sorting process at various speeds.
- **Array Size Control**: Change the size of the array to visualize sorting on different input sizes.
- **Color Coding**: Visualize the comparison and swap operations with different colors to better understand the sorting algorithm.

## Technologies Used

The Sorting Visualizer is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: Markup language for structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling language to enhance the appearance of the visualizer.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language to implement the sorting algorithms and handle the visualization logic.
- 

## Installation

To run the Sorting Visualizer locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Prureddy/Sorting-Visualizer-front-end)`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Sorting-Visualizer-front-end`
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

- Choose a sorting algorithm from the available options.
- Adjust the speed and array size using the respective controls.
- Click the "Generate Array" button to generate a new array or provide a custom input.
- Click the "Sort" button to start the visualization process.
- Observe the array getting sorted and the bars being rearranged in real time.
